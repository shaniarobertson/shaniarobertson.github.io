# acnhbellcalc
The ACNH Bell Calc is a re-make of a project of my friend's first web app project: https://github.com/kylenotfound/ACNH-Bell-Calculator

My version was used as a lesson of utilizing data from a third-party API.

The ACNH Bell Calc is based off of items you can sell in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizon's. To use it, you would search for, and "Add to Cart", items from your inventory to see a running total of the currency, bells, before selling your items.
